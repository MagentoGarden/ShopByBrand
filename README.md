Introduction
------------

Shop by Brand extension for Magento enables you to create separate pages for brands presented in your store and link to them from product pages, thus making it easier for your customers to browse and shop by specific brands. Instead of brands names you can use any category relevant to your store - such as manufacturers, artists, authors, etc. The extension can be applied to any number of single-select attributes simultaneously, so your customers can shop by multiple attributes. So, for example, you can have Shop By Brands, Shop By Color, Shop By Collection and etc. at the same time. This solution has been successfully used by a great number of major online stores for years and it's now available for Magento!
